        <h1>Registration at Offwind</h1>

        <h2>Why would you register?</h2>
        <p>By registering you will get an access to tools and additional materials.
        Offwind can also inform you about interesting events and features if you subscribe for it.</p>

        <h2>Is it safe?</h2>
        <p>It is absolutely safe. We don't send unnecessary things to your email unless you request it.
        Passwords are saved in encrypted form, which makes it proof to compromise.</p>

        <h2>Is it easy?</h2>
        <p>The registration process is very simple. After you enter
        email and password (and probably additional information about you and your company) you will be notified by email for confirmation. That's it!</p>
